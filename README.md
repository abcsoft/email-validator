## Usage

1. Run the script by typing `python mailvalid.py` in the terminal or command line.

2. When prompted, enter the path of your CSV or TXT file that contains the email addresses to be validated.

3. The script will output two files in the same directory as your input file: `valid_emails.txt` and `invalid_emails.txt`. These files contain the valid and invalid emails, respectively.

## Software Requirements

Python 3.6 or later is required to run this script. You will also need the pandas library, which can be installed using pip, Python's package installer.
